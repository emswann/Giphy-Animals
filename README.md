# Giphy-Animals

Giphy Animals presents the user with a list of animals. The list can be added to or deleted from. When a user clicks on an animal name, giphy images are displayed. Initially, the images are still. When a user clicks on an animal image, the images will move. The images move until the user clicks again to stop the image. The images work independently and a user can start or stop movement on any image.

The application includes error checking to make sure duplicate animals are not added nor non-existing animals deleted. It also checks for empty text when submitted.
